I'm Aviv Gatya, a Unity C# Developer, In this Github you can find 3 projects:
1. 27 solutions to problem from famous Euler project
2. Game I made for Android, I have already uploaded the app to Gogle Play but it takes Google time to approve it,
   so right now you can download the apk to your phone through Drive or USB.
3. Game I made for android but right now you can play it on Browser, link is in the project window.

Both games are not done yet, and have couple of bugs and features that are about to be upgraded soon.
Have fun.
